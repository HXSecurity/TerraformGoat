## Description

This is a vulnerability environment shooting range for building GCP cloud storage unrestricted file upload.

After building the environment with Terraform, Users can upload any file to cloud storage through PUT method.

## Deployment Environment

```shell
docker cp key.json terraformgoat:/terraformgoat # run on the host
docker exec -it terraformgoat /bin/bash  # run on the host
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file key.json # run on the container
```

Execute the following command in the container

```shell
cd /TerraformGoat/object_storage_service/gcp/unrestricted_file_upload/
```

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and fill in the file with your `gcp project id`

```shell
vim terraform.tfvars
```

Deploy Vulnerable Environment
