# Huawei Cloud ECS SSRF Vulnerable Environment

English | [中文](./README_CN.md)

## Description

This is a scenario used to build the Huawei Cloud ECS SSRF vulnerability environment.

After building the environment with Terraform, users can obtain metadata and user data and other information on ECS through the SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Deployment Environment

Execute the following command in the container

```shell
cd /TerraformGoat/huaweicloud/elastic_computing_service/ecs_ssrf/
```

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and fill in the file with your `huaweicloud_access_key` and `huaweicloud_secret_key`.

> The access key can be found in HUAWEI CLOUD [Console --> My Credentials]

read user data

> The premise is that the target has been configured with user data, otherwise will be disconnected.

```shell
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
```

In the user data information, you can see that there is a flag file in the root directory of the scenario, try to use SSRF to read this file.

```shell
file:///flag69152201.txt
```
